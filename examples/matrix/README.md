## Installation

Make sure you are in the [examples/matrix](.) folder. In the terminal (Linux bash, Windows Cygwin, or Gitbash), run the following commands:

```sh
# creates the build directory
cmake -E make_directory build

# enters the build directory
cd build

# configures the build environment
cmake ..

# builds the project according to the configuration
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

```text
Program takes 2 parameters. 
First, you choose one of the following layouts:
1) rows
2) columns
3) z_curve (the size has to be a power of 2)
Then you input integer matrix size. 
The size of the matrix have to be at least one.
(for example simplicity, only square matrices are supported)
```

Running the example on Windows:

```text
.\matrix.exe rows 7
```

Running the example on Linux or Mac:

```text
./matrix columns 10
./matrix z_curve 8
```

## Implementation

Implementation is commented on in detail. We recommend starting reading [matrix.cpp](matrix.cpp), following with [noarr_matrix_functions.hpp](noarr_matrix_functions.hpp) and [z_curve.hpp](z_curve.hpp) last.

In file [matrix.cpp](matrix.cpp) basic matrix is implemented. Example first generates 2 classic matrices. Then it copies them into a noarr version. The example then performs multiplications separately. It then copies the noarr result into a normal version and compares the results if they are equal.

In file [noarr_matrix_functions.hpp](noarr_matrix_functions.hpp) are implemented several matrix functions. The important function is:

```cpp
template<class Matrix, class Matrix2, class Structure3>
auto noarr_matrix_multiply(Matrix& matrix1, Matrix2& matrix2, 
    Structure3 structure)
```

it is given 2 matrices and it multiplies them, product matrix uses `Structure3` as its structure.

You are able to choose from several layouts. The first two are modeled using basic `noarr` features. The third one is using `z_curve` implemented in [z_curve.cpp](z_curve.cpp).
